- Indexes on database
- Proper outside application handling password generation
- Shot results might be candidate to another database type, because: 
    - it varies a lot
    - SGBDR storage will be redundant and heavy 
    -> a solution could be to use Cassandra, or Mongo
    -> Maybe just store results of challenge (flatten)
- JWT + RSA
- Redis custom repositories to handle key value properly (like it was done in iHub) without code duplication and automatic use of RedisKey
- GenericClientError.RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND -> Should be logging type if resource....
- Real paiements and due paiements module
- Docker JAVA 11 alpine when prod ready (check online, last check 01/11/19 not ready)
- Postgres over MySQL ?
- `minValue` and `maxValue` for disciplines ?
