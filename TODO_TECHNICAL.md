- Proper SQL Initialization
- Indexes on database
- Proper outside application handling password generation
- Shot results might be candidate to another database type, because: 
    - it varies a lot
    - SGBDR storage will be redundant and heavy 
    -> a solution could be to use Cassandra, or Mongo
- JWT + RSA
- Configure prod docker compose by removing defaults -> Redis does not even work with an empty "" password like it's done now
- TODO change redis persistence format ? Looks like things are stored duplicated
