- Proper SQL Initialization
- Indexes on database
- Proper outside application handling password generation
- Shot results might be candidate to another database type, because: 
    - it varies a lot
    - SGBDR storage will be redundant and heavy 
    -> a solution could be to use Cassandra, or Mongo
