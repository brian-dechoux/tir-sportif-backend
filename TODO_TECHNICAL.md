- Proper SQL Initialization
- Indexes on database
- Proper outside application handling password generation
- Shot results might be candidate to another database type, because: 
    - it varies a lot
    - SGBDR storage will be redundant and heavy 
    -> a solution could be to use Cassandra, or Mongo
    -> Maybe just store results of challenge (flatten)
- JWT + RSA
- Redis custom repositories to handle key value properly (like it was done in iHub) without code duplication and automatic use of RedisKey
- Real paiements and due paiements module
